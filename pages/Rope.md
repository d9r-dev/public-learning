- In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), a **rope**, or **cord**, is a [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) composed of smaller [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) that is used to efficiently store and manipulate a very long string. For example, a [text editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editing) program may use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and random access can be done efficiently.
- A rope is a type of [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) where each leaf (end node) holds a string and a length (also known as a "weight"), and each node further up the tree holds the sum of the lengths of all the leaves in its left [subtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtree). A node with two children thus divides the whole string into two parts: the left subtree stores the first part of the string, the right subtree stores the second part of the string, and a node's weight is the length of the first part.
- For rope operations, the strings stored in nodes are assumed to be constant [immutable objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) in the typical nondestructive case, allowing for some [copy-on-write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write) behavior. Leaf nodes are usually implemented as [basic fixed-length strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) with a [reference count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) attached for deallocation when no longer needed, although other [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) methods can be used as well.
