- **Preload** the late discovered ressources
	- preload is a declarative fetch request that tells the browser to request a ressource that is otherwise not discoverable by the browser like images in background css code
	- Preload late-discovered resources by adding a `<link>` tag with `rel="preload"` to the head of your HTML document
	- Adding a `<link rel="preload">` directive will initiate a request for that resource and store it in the cache. The browser is then able to retrieve it when needed.
- **Render** the initial route as soon as possible
-
- **Pre-Cache** remaining assets
- **Lazy load** other routes and none-critical assets
