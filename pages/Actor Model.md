- Conceptual model of concurrent computation from 1973
- Actor is a fundamental unit of computation
	- allowed operations of an actor are:
		- Create another actor
		- send a message
		- designate how to handle the next message
	- holds his own private state
	- actors are isolated by each other and dont share memory
	- state of the actor can only changed by messages
	- messages are send to actors and are handled in FIFO (First In First Out) order
